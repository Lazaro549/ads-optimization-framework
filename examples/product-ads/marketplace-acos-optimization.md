## Objective

Reduce ACOS while maintaining revenue stability.

Platform Logic:
Auction-based bidding with ACOS target.

---

## Initial Metrics

Revenue: $25,000  
Ad Spend: $6,250  
ACOS: 25%  
Target ACOS: 18%  

CTR: 1.8%  
Conversion Rate: 6.5%

---

## Diagnosis

- Conversion rate strong → product-market fit confirmed
- ACOS above target → overbidding or inefficient budget distribution
- Some SKUs showed ACOS > 35%

Problem:
Budget allocated equally instead of performance-tier based

---

## Optimization Strategy

1. Segmented campaigns by performance tier:
   - Tier 1: ACOS < 15%
   - Tier 2: ACOS 15–25%
   - Tier 3: ACOS > 25%

2. Increased bids for Tier 1
3. Reduced bids for Tier 3
4. Paused two consistently inefficient SKUs
5. Reallocated budget toward high-margin products
