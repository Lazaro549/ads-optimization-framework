# Multi-Campaign Portfolio Scaling Case

## Objective

Scale total account revenue by 40% while maintaining blended ROAS ≥ 3.0

---

## Portfolio Structure

Campaign A – Growth  
Campaign B – Profitability  
Campaign C – Testing  

---

## Baseline (Blended)

Total Revenue: $80,000  
Total Ad Spend: $25,000  
Blended ROAS: 3.2  

---

## Scaling Framework Applied

Step 1: Identified top-performing audience clusters  
Step 2: Duplicated into scaling campaign  
Step 3: Increased budget gradually (20% increments weekly)  
Step 4: Monitored marginal ROAS  
Step 5: Stopped scaling when marginal ROAS < 2.8

## Final Results (60 Days)

Total Revenue: $115,000  
Total Ad Spend: $37,000  
Blended ROAS: 3.1  

Revenue Growth: +43%  
Efficiency maintained within threshold.

## Key Insight

Scaling requires monitoring marginal performance,
not only overall averages.

Blended ROAS can hide inefficiencies.

Portfolio thinking > campaign thinking.
