# Ads Optimization Framework
![Ads Optimization Framework](resources/assets/ads-optimization-framework.png)
A structured methodology for optimizing paid media campaigns across multiple advertising platforms.

## Overview

The **Ads Optimization Framework** is a performance-driven system designed to improve advertising efficiency, maximize return on investment, and build scalable paid media strategies.

This repository documents principles, metrics, optimization workflows, and testing methodologies used in Display Ads and other performance marketing channels.

The goal is to approach advertising not as isolated campaigns, but as a continuous optimization process based on data, experimentation, and strategic bidding.

## Core Philosophy

Advertising performance depends on three main pillars:

1. Traffic Quality
2. Conversion Efficiency
3. Budget & Bidding Control

Optimization is achieved by improving one or more of these pillars while maintaining sustainable acquisition costs.

---

## Key Metrics

This framework focuses on measurable performance indicators:

- CTR (Click-Through Rate)
- CPC (Cost Per Click)
- CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
- ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales)
- Conversion Rate
- Impression Share

Each metric is analyzed not in isolation, but in relation to funnel stage and campaign objective.

## Optimization Process

### 1. Define Objective
- Growth
- Profitability
- Product visibility
- Market penetration

### 2. Establish Target Efficiency
- Target ROAS
- Target ACOS
- Target CPA

### 3. Diagnose Performance Gaps
- Low CTR → Creative or targeting issue
- High CPC → Bidding or competition pressure
- Low CVR → Landing or offer misalignment
- High ACOS → Revenue-to-cost imbalance

### 4. Implement Controlled Tests
- Creative variations
- Audience segmentation
- Bid adjustments
- Budget redistribution

### 5. Measure & Iterate
Optimization is cyclical. Data informs the next hypothesis.

## Bidding Strategy Model

Campaign performance is influenced by:

Ad Rank = Bid Strategy × Ad Quality

Higher efficiency comes from balancing:
- Competitive bidding
- High-quality creatives
- Relevant targeting

The objective is not to bid higher — but to bid smarter.

---

## Campaign Structure Principles

- Segment by objective, not by product volume
- Separate scaling campaigns from testing campaigns
- Allocate budget based on performance tiers
- Pause underperforming assets quickly
- Double down on profitable segments

---

## Testing Framework

All optimizations follow a structured testing methodology:

- One variable at a time
- Minimum data threshold before conclusions
- Clear success metric
- Defined testing window
- Documented results

---

## Platforms Covered

- Display Advertising
- Search Advertising
- Marketplace Ads (e.g., Product Ads models)
- Social Media Ads

The framework is platform-agnostic and performance-focused.

---

## Future Additions

- Case studies
- Real optimization logs
- Budget allocation models
- Scaling playbooks
- Advanced bidding simulations
