# Campaign Structure Principles

Structure defines clarity, control, and scalability.

---

## Segmentation by Objective

Do not group campaigns only by product.

Segment by:

- Growth vs Profitability
- Testing vs Scaling
- High-margin vs Low-margin products

---

## Funnel-Based Structure

Top Funnel:
- Awareness
- Broader targeting

Mid Funnel:
- Consideration
- Audience refinement

Bottom Funnel:
- Conversion
- High intent audiences

---

## Scaling Logic

1. Identify profitable segment
2. Duplicate into scaling campaign
3. Increase budget gradually
4. Monitor efficiency thresholds

---

## Common Structural Mistakes

- Mixing testing and scaling in one campaign
- Over-segmentation without data
- Increasing budget before validating profitability
