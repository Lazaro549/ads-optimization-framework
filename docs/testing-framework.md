## Testing Principles

- Test one variable at a time
- Define success metric before launch
- Set minimum data threshold
- Establish testing window

---

## Variables to Test

- Creative variations
- Audience segmentation
- Bid adjustments
- Budget distribution
- Placement optimization

## Test Evaluation Model

Step 1: Define hypothesis  
Step 2: Launch controlled variation  
Step 3: Collect statistically relevant data  
Step 4: Compare against baseline  
Step 5: Implement winning variation

## Scaling Rule

Only scale validated winners.

Never scale assumptions.
