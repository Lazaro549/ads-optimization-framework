This document defines the core KPIs used in the Ads Optimization Framework and how they interact.

## Traffic Metrics

### Impressions
Number of times an ad is shown.

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)
CTR = Clicks / Impressions

Indicates creative relevance and audience alignment.

Low CTR → Creative, targeting, or positioning issue.

---

## Cost Metrics

### CPC (Cost Per Click)
CPC = Total Spend / Clicks

Reflects auction competitiveness and bidding efficiency.

High CPC → Overbidding or high competition.

---

## Conversion Metrics

### Conversion Rate (CVR)
CVR = Conversions / Clicks

Indicates landing page alignment and offer strength.

Low CVR → Funnel misalignment.

### CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
CPA = Total Spend / Conversions

Defines acquisition efficiency.

---

## Revenue Metrics

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend

Measures revenue efficiency.

### ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales)
ACOS = Ad Spend / Revenue

Inverse of ROAS.

Lower ACOS → Higher profitability.

## Performance Diagnosis Matrix

- High CTR + Low CVR → Landing issue
- Low CTR + High CPC → Targeting inefficiency
- High CVR + High ACOS → Pricing or margin issue
- Low Impression Share → Budget or bid limitation

Optimization must consider metric relationships, not isolated numbers.
